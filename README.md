### What I learned

The difficult part of this challenge was placing an overlay on the image of the 3d-cube. I couldn't quite figure out where I needed to place my classes or where I needed to place the `div` for the overlay. After watching the video mentioned in [useful resources](#useful-resources), I composed the following HTML:

Now that I had my HTML in place, I was able to compose corresponding CSS:

### Useful resources

- [Overlay:hover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exb2ab72Xhs) - This video by dcode helped me create an overlay and position it over the image of the 3d-cube. I really liked this video as they explain the reasoning behind their decision-making, which made it easier for me to understand how to apply the concepts to my HTML and CSS.
